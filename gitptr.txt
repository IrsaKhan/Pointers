Basics,

Addresses in RAM , pointers point to those addresses , which means they store address

**“Pointers are variables that store addresses”**

Pointers are generally “Type specific”

***int - 4 Bytes*** 

***char - 1 Byte***

***Float - 4 Bytes***

Then there is a **Void Pointer** that is not type specific

`void *ptr;`
